! find all CS_NAME usage, check 7th bit for each char, replace with color
  ! server: do not colorize string for old clients
! build brushes for other-than-SOLID contents (for all contents != 0)
? changing HL map: may display old name on loading splash (sometimes name changed after map start? after Com_DropError()?)

- texture loading:
  * from map (q1)
  - from wad (hl)
  - should delete all textures (map textures) on next map loading:
    - q1: embedded textures: should delete all on map change (different maps -- may be different textures
      with the same name)
    - hl: wad textures: different maps => different wads ...

- surface flags (translucent, sky, warp ...)
  + check 'Docs/hl.txt'
- surface sounds (hl)
- inplement "func_illusionary" etc (static entities with and without collision; sfx too)

- entities (hl)

- ambient sounds (see dBsp1Leaf_t)

- .mdl models for Q1 (torch etc)

- check player trace bounds + viewheight for q1/hl
- hl: increase entity limit (CS_... -- SV_FindIndex())
- q1/hl: check lightstyle strings
? force ext protocol for clients

?! ents: convert q1 NPC to q2 NPC
- check HL animMap.freq (HL viewer: 10 Hz; Q1 - 5 Hz; Q2 - 2 Hz)
- hl: map 'bounce' have large water area with lightmaps; water activatad by special texture?
- hl: light_environment; + check "lights.rad" file (SURF_LIGHT analog)
