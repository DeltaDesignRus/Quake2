- disabling lightmaps on some surfaces (trans, alpha - neon messages etc.) -- do it with spec. shader keyword,
  don't specify LM stage in shader or another way -- fullbright?
- map scale (mostly for KP)
? sun/ambient light
- change sky
* coronas (size, color, lightstyle, position, radius (for placing inside objects, e.g. lamp))
- inline shaders (easy!)
- surface sounds (local materials.lst)
! C-style preprocessor (#include, at least) -- may be, inside COM_Parse?
! entity editor (not convert, just "add"/"remove" for entire entities or fields)
- shader manipulations (FAKK2, "fromEntity")
