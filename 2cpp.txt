* create "makefile generator" tool first (easier to rename *.c to *.cpp)
  * generic makefile (exe+gl+soft bundle)
  * makefile for dedicated server (DEDICATED_ONLY + refine set of source files)
  * makefile for splitted renderers
    ! REF_HARD_LINKED: rename define
  - makefile for integrated gl-only executable (NO_SOFT_RENDERER, vid_dll.c only + remove ref_soft/* files from makefile)
    (when no soft renderer - single renderer only - can remove vid_ref cvar)
- renderer:
  - make as class
    ? console-only renderer: can't replace virtual functions to dummy (vid_dll.c, D_Xxxx() function family)
- math:
  - WorldToModelCoord() etc.: make CWorldObject class with position+axis props + conversion funcs
- network:
  - make channel_t (different name ??) as class, TcpChannel+LoopbackChannel as childs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- WinMain():
  appInit() -- pass NULL (==outputDevice) for GUI and OutputDeviceWin32Console for dedicated (cvar "dedicated" unknown here ?)
- CL_Init: set (add) OutputDeviceConsole
  ? func SetOutputDevice() - can add output devices
- appPrintf() etc:
  - should be able to use few output devices
  - ability to hook output (for rcon etc)
- COutputDevice:
    bool useColors -- when "false" - UncolString before output (e.g. for file logging)
- CErrorDevice:
    bool fatalError
    bool softError
    char errorHistory[]
    void Reset()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changing renderer system:
  - make build target: "static build with single renderer"
  - change GetRefAPI() -> something another
  - separate renderer (math only) and backend (OpenGL)
  - backend should provide "caps" field:
    - rect textures (GL_NV_texture_rectangle: clamp, no mipmap)
    - rect textures 2 (GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two: full-feautered textures)
    - compressed textures (for disabling by menu)
    - fast blend (for soft renderer: can draw console etc with opaque rects)
    - fast culling (for soft: when "false" will try to cull everything before sending to backend)
    - some lighting info (software, hardware with/without cubemaps etc)
  - images.cpp -> renderer (not backend)
  - (abstract) class CImage, wisible from GUI/client - implementation in renderer, some service funcs
    (uploading, retreiving from screen, rendering to texture) - in backend
  ? vid_restart: restart backend ? (renderer restarting - unneded ??); rename cmd ?
  ? share model/map loading with cmodel (separate into own library, used by server/client/renderer)
