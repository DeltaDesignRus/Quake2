?! savegame shot: when loading game/show "load menu" from non-baseq2, shot will be displayed when it is not exists in current mod,
   (saved without shot) but exists in baseq2 (incorrect shot; BUT: situation, when save exists but shot -- not, may be treated as incorrect)
- explosions are invisible through non-transparent water (incorrect server-side PVS cull ?) -- should be at least dlights ?? (or not?)
- baseq2, "rhino" model, singleplayer (multiplayer not tested): when changing rhino skin, in 3rd person will appear "(no model)" 3D-label
  for weapon (have no VWEP, have minimal "weapon.md2" only) -- Q2 analyzes VWEP presence on game initialization only, and don't recheck
  on model/skin change ?!

- bugs with deathmatch mode
  - map "dm_dukecity_beta":
    - disco: neon lamp text should not disappear
  ? g_misc.c::SP_light() -- disabled lights with style>=32

- when sound is busy, error about "command already registered" appears for sound commands

? game crush in msvcrt.dll (pak loading/unloading/download breaking/map not found)
? crush on map change/game load with Anachronox map : crush when door/elevator moving somewhere on level -- absolute pointers ?

- bug: "game baseq2;unloadpak q2maps;game bad_dir(?);demomap demo1;game baseq2(?);demomap demo1"
  (1st demomap - "cannot load map (q2maps not loaded)", 2nd - "bad map contents (pak loaded, but name cached??)"

? once: tried to draw main menu cursor with a negative image number (should be 0..15): menu.c :: M_DrawCursor()
- menus: when renderer changed (with a different resolution!) - menus should be repositioned (fatal errors may appear)

- z-buffer bugs with glass floor on "omd_map1"

- filesystem:
  - when q2 launched from "release" directory (w/o baseq2 subdir), FS "search paths" will be empty, "dir" command will not work at all

- without WIN32_USE_SEH, crash log will contain error history only


UNRECOVARABLE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- rogue demo3: ".../items/defender/tris..." - linked NULL-model entity (modelindex2 > max available model index)
  reason: old rogue used linked model ".../shell/...", but link was created using "modelindex|0x80"; now rogue is new, but this
  demo was recorded using this buggy game


BUGGY MAPS:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- "reboot" (from KP, user-created) pos(-658,-242,-178) dir(-0.91,0.39,0) -- incorrect backface culling in gl (OK in oldgl); reason:
  gl and oldgl have different backface culling (gl -- DotProduct(videdir,normal); oldgl -- using BSP only, w/o DotProduct()), this
  map have incorrect normal info for this surface (if look at r_surfinfo, can see: incorrect brushes too - to simplify map navigation ?)
  To fix: can rebuild normals for draw surfaces
- "winter" (AQ2) pos(-1023,463,55) dir(0,1,0) - incorrect backface culling in gl (OK in oldgl) (same as "reboot")
- game=dirty, map "mine4" (baseq2), laser cannon -- when shoot rock, invisible entity painted (should not be entity at all, "hall of mirrors"
  effect appears); check with baseq2 (sp+deathmatch); when do it 2nd time (wall respawned in DM) - all OK
- "team_harbor" (KP, 3rd-party) - PF_SetModel() -- NULL name (game=dirty; with baseq2 - no problems)
  ? try to create empty (dummy) model and assign it from PF_SetModel(name==NULL) calls

HARDWARE:
~~~~~~~~~
- ATI:
  - when uploading rectangular texture (GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV) with compressed internal format, app will crash in ICD GL dll
  - (old drivers) when game launched fullscreen, <Alt-Enter> will switch to windowed mode with incorrect viewport (visible region);
    vid_restart will not fix situation
  - (Catalyst 4.9) GL_SGIS_multitexture: GL_MAX_TEXTURES_SGIS == 0
  * gamma: after app startup (screen resolution changing) drivers will set gamma==1; tech info: main window will get messages:
    WM_SYNCPAINT, WM_NCPAINT, WM_ERASEBKGND, WM_PAINT; Q3 have no this problem, UT2004 (GL) have.
    * FIXED: set TOPMOST wnd attribute with SetWindowPos(), not with SetWindowLong(); when restore from minimized state - update
      gamma in AppActivate() using "r_gamma->modified=true" i.e. in 1st rendering frame, not using UpdateGamma() call
- NV
  - (NV:bitdepth change, Blade3D:vid_restart): cannot restart GL with Vid_DestroyWindow(force=false) -- require to recreate window
  - screenshot is black after changing color depth, but all OK when make one more vid_restart (TNT2, Win2K, 41.09)
  - GF FX5200 + det.56.72, compiled_vertex_array: have geometry bugs when mixing non-CVA & CVA rendering (disappear with
    gl_showtris=1); workaround: CVA is ALWAYS used (i.e. for 1-pass rendering too); ATI have no this bug
  - GF FX5200: GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc: font image, compressed into DXT1 (with 1-bit alpha) have visual bugs (pink color on
    letters); no bug with DXT5
? texture rectangle (ATI; NV untested): when "*video" created as regular texture and uploaded as rect texture, after displaying
  video (exec alias "d1" -- video+demo) when level loading, displayed black rect instead of "loading" banner
- notebook keyboard: when pushing arrow keys with <Shift>, <Shift> will be unpressed while other keys is down (unable to move
  crouched)

SOURCE FILES (COMPILER):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- (VisualC++ 6) when compiling renderer with DYNAMIC_REF:
  - "unguard" will be linked to "NORETURN struc.appUnwindThrow()"; VC ignores NORETURN here,
    and will display warning C4715 (not all control paths return value)
  - FS_LoadFile(filename, &len) have arg "unsigned *len"; using this via structure will produce warning C4700
    (local variable used without having been initialized)
