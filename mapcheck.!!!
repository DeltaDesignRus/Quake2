GRAPHICS
~~~~~~~~
- map "resort": have too dark sun light (very dark map itself; lightmaps looks buggy)
- map "mxcity": have "_sun_surface" (different from sky surf->value)
- map "tacoma": whole map lighted with spotlights (cone=2000, i.e. pointlight; style=32 - not cached; lightmaps saturated with blue color)
- map "uatown", "village2": lighted only with point lights; have minlight ??
- map "washing": very dark map, most light - from sky (SURF_LIGHT)
- map "civilwar": point lights only; most light from 1 light ("sun"), in shadows - emission from other surfaces
- map "chasm", "dream": complex map with lots of different-color point lights ("dream": + many colorized windows)
- "snakesmap": have "_sun_ambient"
* "pc": have "_ambient", "_sun_light"==1
- "tokyo": have many sun shadows; hane "_sun_ambient"
- "dock": have 2 suns (and, seems, sun1 is specified with bad angles) -- VERY BUGGY MAP
- "paradise": 2 suns
- "citygate2": light from sky, but sky texture is absent
- "market": have sun ambient + should not cast light from sky surface
- "cliff"/"cliff2": errors in entity lighting -- specified sun (incorrect way!), but no SURF_LIGHT+SKY; so: sunlight from straight
  up direction (ignore SURF_LIGHT + ignore direction)
- "seweratz": dark map with many shadows
- "arcadia": sun+sun_ambient+ LOTS of SURF_LIGHT
- "mosquito": too dark shadows; whole map lighted with 3 pointlights
- "cucu40a": have 1 dark place (originally lighted with reflected light)
* "ckcomp1": have minlight, specified from command line (can be taken from map's readme)
- "darkalley": have too dark places (but walls are lighted)
- "kumanru": very bright sky (SURF_LIGHT), secondary light sources (too dark shadows)

* "pier2": minlight (cmdline)
* "ruins3": minlight
- "urban": have "light" in entstring, but, seems, no ambient while radiocity
------------------------------

------------------------------

MISC
~~~~
? "beachassault": when standing on wall (upstairs) inside ship projector cone, lighting may be incorrect when AddPointLight()
  uses VectorNormalizeFast() instead of VectorNormalize() to detect distance/direction

PHYSICS
~~~~~~~
- "japan" - underwater have brush sides between 2 water brushes; clipped on this sides (3rd person, r_surfinfo etc.)
- map (q2:) "fusion", (aq2:) "temple2", "lavatube" -- waterfall have func_splash with same flags, as water bullethit splash
