! map "urban_wreckage", {147, 1149, -66}: sky may be clipped by frustum incorrectly

?! savegame shot: when loading game/show "load menu" from non-baseq2, shot will be displayed when it is not exists in current mod,
   (saved without shot) but exists in baseq2 (incorrect shot; BUT: situation, when save exists but shot -- not, may be treated as incorrect)
- explosions are invisible through non-transparent water (incorrect server-side PVS cull ?)
- dedicated server: work without ref, so - crush when try some things (i.e. "com_speeds 1") --> make fake ref
  (and add support for colors, scrolling etc.)
- when gl_clear=1, cinematics is not displayed (requires GL_BeginFrame before DrawStretchRaw(); currently BeginFrame code executed
  immediately after GL_EndFrame from backend command buffer, but DrawStretchRaw() called BEFORE GL_EndFrame -- EndFrame will erase raw
  drawings)

- bugs with deathmatch mode
  - map "dm_dukecity_beta":
    - disco: neon lamp text should not disappear
  ? g_misc.c::SP_light() -- disabled lights with style>=32

- filesystem:
  - "dir ../dirty/maps" will display the same list twice
  - when q2 launched from "release" directory (w/o baseq2 subdir), FS "search paths" will be empty, "dir" command will not work at all

- when sound is busy, error about "command already registered" appears for sound commands

! cannot load map "dog..." in soft: "bad surface extents 272 x XXX" (but GL can ...; seems, ref_soft
  can't render texture with larger than 256 size ...)
! map "toomuchbloodv2": sound "dmg/TISM.wav" loaded twice (upper- and lowercase)
  + add mask support for soundlist

? game crush in msvcrt.dll (pak loading/unloading/download breaking/map not found)
? crush on map change/game load with Anachronox map : crush when door/elevator moving somewhere on level -- absolute pointers ?

- z-buffer bugs with glass floor on omd_map1

- ref_soft/r_poly.c "R_PolygonScanLeft(Right)Edge ()" should be rewritten
  ("ground3": early - crash, now - lost polygons ...)
- ref_soft hangs on map "japan" (from Kingpin)

- bug: "game baseq2;unloadpak q2maps;game bad_dir(?);demomap demo1;game baseq2(?);demomap demo1"
  (1st demomap - "cannot load map (q2maps not loaded)", 2nd - "bad map contents (pak loaded, but name cached??)"

ref_oldgl:
  map passin;map passin (BUGS!!!); map rexro (CRUSH!!!)  (this bug found only for passin -- bad map? no bug when "flushmap 1")

- map team_harbor: PF_SetModel() -- NULL name
- once: tried to draw main menu cursor with a negative image number (should be 0..15): menu.c :: M_DrawCursor() (added "unsigned"
  to resolve ?)


UNRECOVARABLE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- rogue demo3: ".../items/defender/tris..." - linked NULL-model entity (modelindex2 > max available model index)
  reason: old rogue used linked model ".../shell/...", but link was created using "modelindex|0x80"; now rogue is new, but this
  demo was recorded using this buggy game


HARDWARE:
~~~~~~~~~
- ATI:
  - when uploading rectangular texture (GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV) with compressed internal format, app will crash in ICD GL dll
  - when game launched fullscreen, <Alt-Enter> will switch to windowed mode with incorrect viewport (visible region);
    vid_restart will not fix situation
- NV
  - (NV:bitdepth change, Blade3D:vid_restart): cannot restart GL with Vid_DestroyWindow(force=false) -- require to recreate window
  - screenshot is black after changing color depth, but all OK when make one more vid_restart (TNT2, Win2K, 41.09)
  - GF FX5200 + det.56.72, compiled_vertex_array: have geometry bugs when mixing non-CVA & CVA rendering (disappear with
    gl_showtris=1); workaround: CVA is ALWAYS used (i.e. for 1-pass rendering too); ATI have no this bug
? texture rectangle (ATI; NV untested): when "*video" created as regular texture and uploaded as rect texture, after displaying
  video (exec alias "d1" -- video+demo) when level loading, displayed black rect instead of "loading" banner
- notebook keyboard: when pushing arrow keys with <Shift>, <Shift> will be unpressed while other keys is down (unable to move
  crouched)
