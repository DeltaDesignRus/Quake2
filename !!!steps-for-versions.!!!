*. new tree system inside cmodel.cpp (CBspNode/CBspLeaf)
   - NOTE: q1 currently uses LoadNodes() then LoadLeafs(); but new system requires LoadLeafs() then LoadNodes()
    (?? may be not required: can simply allocate memory for leafs before LoadNodes())
   ! check renderer's bsp for q1 map: bsp for cmodel generated additional leafs for SOLID contents
   - should build tree structure (setup parents)
2. use new tree system inside renderer
3. implement Q3 map loading
