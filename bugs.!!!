  ("ground3": early - crash, now - lost polygons ...)
- ref_soft hangs on map "japan" (from Kingpin)
- ref_gl: SURF_ALPHA is buggy in 1 or 2 places in map "rc3"

- name conflict REF_HARD_LINKED Win32/irix (???)

- bug: "game baseq2;unloadpak q2maps;game bad_dir(?);demomap demo1;game baseq2(?);demomap demo1"

ref_soft:
  r_main.c: STRINGER macro doesn't works (iD's bug)

ref_gl:
  DrawTile(): when viewport is small and gl_clear=1 - bugs on a left screen part

ref_oldgl:
  map passin;map passin (BUGS!!!); map rexro (CRUSH!!!)  (this bug found only for passin -- bad map? no bug when "flushmap 1")
