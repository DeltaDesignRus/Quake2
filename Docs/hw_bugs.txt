BUG001: NV, GeForce2 MX, WinXP, GL_NV_texture_rectangle:
* tested 10.04.2006 with drivers 84.21 on 2MX/200 and GF2MX/400; tested before with 56.64 on GF2MX/400
- when mixing textures with GL_TEXTURE_2D and GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV within a single texture unit,
  switching texture target from one to another may result in lost alpha-channel of texture (next texture
  will be painted as it does not contains alpha-channel)
FIX (found by me):
a) make all textures to have alpha-channel
b) when binding texture within a different texture _target_, bind _any_ texture within alpha-channel and
   target GL_TEXTURE_2D before this
