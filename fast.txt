- EF_BFG, some other - TRANSLUCENT -> shader (cl_ents.cpp)
- map script with builtin shaders; main engine will pass them to renderer
? aminMap with cross-blending (for sprites) -- combiners?
? animMapOnce (check UberEngine function)
- bfg beams: try to find entity, which is damaged, and lerp beam dst to it (beam src should be lerped too)
- sprite system:
  - pos
  - rotate
  - scale
  - alpha
- shader.globalTime -- force to use vp.time; shader.absoluteTime -- use ent.time instead of (vp.time-ent.time) (useful for sprites)
=============
- correct autoflare center -- can get texture coords of surface, and compute, when it's center
- SURF_LIGHT: can specify for some textures, which have large wall + small lamp pic, where lamp is placed (its texcoords) and
  which percent of whole surface its area
- gl_state.haveFullscreen3d -- change (may be, remove var)
=============
- cmd.cpp -> Commands.cpp (Core) & cbuf.cpp (qcommon)
  - SplitCmdline == TokenizeString, diff is 1. delim = '-', 2. delim = ';' (or ' ' ??!)
  - MacroExpand(), cmd_debug, CL_ForwardToServer() -> cbuf code; should parse comments in cfg files here
     too (remove them after FS_LoadFile(cfgfile) !?)
- DeltaEntity():
  - for new protocol try plib-like (dcc32) delta func; display compression ratio (may use old-style delta and
    measure compression for new-style for testing); best place for testing - client (here can test demos too)
  - can create DeltaCompress() and DeltaDecompress() functions for plib-style compression
  - if upgrade compression, should parse demos with
    a) original protocol b)ext protocol, but old-style delta
    c) ext protocol and new-style delta;  may be, change EXT_PROTOCOL_ID too (add version number)
- Q2 menu system: have a LOTS of menu items with callbacks == direct linking to cvar: on Init() reads value
  from cvar, on Modify() write value back to cvar; uses cvar->Clamp() on init
  ! can add text field, and flags QMF_CVAR -- will init menu item from cvar, update
    cvar when item changed (for slider - should specify base + scale)
