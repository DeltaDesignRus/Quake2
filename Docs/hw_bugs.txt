BUG001: NV, GeForce2 MX, WinXP, GL_NV_texture_rectangle:
* tested 10.04.2006 with drivers 84.21 on 2MX/200 and GF2MX/400; tested before with 56.64 on GF2MX/400
- when mixing textures with GL_TEXTURE_2D and GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV within a single texture unit,
  switching texture target from one to another may result in lost alpha-channel of texture (next texture
  will be painted as it does not contains alpha-channel)
FIX (found by me):
a) make all textures to have alpha-channel
b) when binding texture within a different texture _target_, bind _any_ texture within alpha-channel and
   target GL_TEXTURE_2D before this

BUG002: NV, GeForce 6800, WinXP, texture compression:
* tested 25.07.2007 with drivers 93.50, 94.24, 162.18 on GF6800 (512Mb); not appeared on GF8xxx
- condition is not clean, reproduction: launch q3.bat with def. map "q3dm10", then start map "cpm15"
  (from console) - will crash in BK_FlushShader->GL_DrawRangeElements->nvoglnt.dll with FPU exception; all
  OK when FPU exceptions are OFF
- reason: using compressed formats for textures with alpha channel
  - crash with any alpha format from any extension: EXT, ARB, or S3; really, should disable texture
    compression at all ?!
  - can use gl_nobind=1 or r_lightmap=1 to succesfully load map and turn it off later - game will crash
  - can disable FPU exceptions while loading map, and enable it after visualization - no crash, but when
    moving camera to position, when another similar texture used - game crashed
  - no crash, when gl_picmip >= 1 or when multitexturing is disabled
