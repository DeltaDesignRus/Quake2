! better - create "makefile generator" tool first (easier to rename *.c to *.cpp)
  - generic makefile (exe+gl+soft bundle)
  - makefile for dedicated server (DEDICATED_ONLY + refine set of source files)
  - makefile for splitted renderers (!REF_HARD_LINKED; rename define!)
  - makefile for integrated gl-only executable (NO_SOFT_RENDERER, vid_dll.c only + remove ref_soft/* files from makefile)
    (when no soft renderer - single renderer only - can remove vid_ref cvar)
* DirectInput, DirectSound: vtbl -> classes
- renderer:
  - make as class
    ? console-only renderer: can't replace virtual functions to dummy (vid_dll.c, D_Xxxx() function family)
  * DrawPic(), DrawChar(), DrawFill() (rename to Fill() ?) etc - all funcs with color arg - remove "Color" from name,
    add default argument for color == white
- math:
  - WorldToModelCoord() etc.: make CWorldObject class with position+axis props + conversion funcs
- network:
  - make channel_t (different name ??) as class, TcpChannel+LoopbackChannel as childs
