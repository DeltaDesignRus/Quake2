SOURCE CODE
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Core/Build.h contains non-core consts (game-related stuff)
- Little/Big-Endian
  - use LITTLE_ENDIAN/BIG_ENDIAN defines (not run-time detection !)
  - use inline overloaded functions: LITTLE(short|ushort|int|uint|float), BIG(...)
- appStrcpy, strncpy, strcmp, stricmp -> CRT functions (when required, can make #define strcpy appStrcpy ...)
- GCC: add macros for printf_format-like functions (better control on wrong parameters); check wrong TString<> usage
  as "Str", not "*Str"
- VC2003+: compiler option /LTCG - intermodule optimizations ("link-time code generation") + /GL

COMPILER BUGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- guard/unguard [Slow] not always added: not works for strings.cpp :: appStrcmp(), appStrcpy() etc. (small functions)

TOOL:
~~~~~
? LockVer/UnlockVer - will disable/enable version increment (should display warning during building with disabled version) -
  - OR:
  ! check current date/time, and disable version increment when distance between builds smaller than N minutes
    - always update build date/time, but update version only when time from previous build is large enough (but: do
      not update when building from empty dirs - not rebuilding)
