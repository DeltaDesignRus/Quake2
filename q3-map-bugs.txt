- dlight bugs: wvwq3dm7, estatica

! fog bugs:
  - no fogging on models and particles/sprites/flares
  - "fire" texture (q3tourney5 etc): visible rect with alpha=0
    * q3 perfors fogging via fading alpha surfaces
  ! add fog timings to r_stats
  - should lightscale (*= identityLight) and saturate fog

- map "chartres":
  - have "rgbgen filter" - check Q3 error message
  - no particle trails from blaster on a whole level
  - renderer frontend is very slow
- q3dm7, textures/sfx/computerpurptileb {2480,-246,369 } - have PostLight and PreLight textures near,
  when shooting to PostLight with r_sfx_pause=1, have VERY bright PostLight texture, and not so bright
  PreLight ... Looks like visual artefact
- r_lightmap works incorrect with textures, having alpha-masked textures (some dynamic effect + mask it
  with other static texture) -- may be, switch to PostLight completely? (this will require more optimal
  PostLight for multiple lights + should try to implement texture/lm + PostLight as a single pass ...)

- dum:
  - have long entity string (not enough +4k for entstring, added 16k)
  - have unsupported here "target_push" and "target_teleporter" entities
  - undergroung: skeleton cell: uses translucent surface with lightmap (?) - incorrect PostLight()
! q3dm2 (as example): water shader painted after rail shader !!!

- ut4_abbey: when shooting, will crash in GenerateTexCoordArray() (dlights?)
- cpm15: teleporter {-1090,710,-260} does not works; reason: teleporting from "t4" to "t5": at dst of teleport
  "t5" placed another teleporter, which will immediately teleport player back to "t4"
- cpm18r: {974,-465,558}, look to {1088,-489,620}, gl_labels=2: moving up-down 3 models, central
  occluded (shold not)
! map "q3dm13" (start) -> "q3dm19" (run few seconds) -> "q3matcho...": will display console w/o cursor,
  when "toggleconsole" -> cursor appears; no game mode; when "vid_restart" ->
  "R_FindModel: not found: *9"
  "ERROR: CM_InlineModel: bad number"
  (unstable, but frequent bug)

- q3dm19: "func_bobbing" with "model2" (attached md3 model)
- cpm15: no SURF_SKY on sky surface (incorrect collision) -- may be, should collide with trisurf, not brush?
- cpm26: have movable surface light: {690, 2760, 160} (sliding door)
- af3hex: lots of visual bugs (some things not displayed)
  ? uses patches for this
- q3dm7: renderer uses darker lights from sky - possibly, sky shader was changed after lightmaps created
  (before compilation sky had brighter light values)
- scienselab (UT): glass textures: draw order issues (look at one glass through another)

- estatica: shoot at {-435, -419, 56} -- bugs with dlight (not all surfaces lighted, cut by triangles)
  * note: uses q3map2 pretesselated pathes

Bad maps, kept for incorrect drawing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- runhamster: lots of glass surfaces, incorrect lighting
- spacegl: invisible glass surfaces

Jumppad bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- q3dm17: have floating "armor", which cannot be reached
- klcurces: incorrect behaviour of 'curved' trampolines

Cannot load:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- q3dm6 (TMP): game.dll parser errors
  (placed in q3dm6tmp.pk3; contains missing opening quote, but have closing quote: check next entity after
  "model" "*3" - "trigger_push")
- paradise: SV_FindIndex(...md2) overflow -- too much models (CPM hacky movement training map, LOTS of trigger_push)

Large maps (out of possible q2 ranges)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- qxctf2
- evotm: map completely outside q2 world bounds
- rjlctf2
- 17plus-ctf

unsupported sky surfaces:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- milktdm1: curve sky: textures/skies/hellsky2bright

Patch lights:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- aetime
- pro-q3dm6
- q3dm4, q3dm10, q3dm11, q3dm12
- cpm14

Trisurf lights:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- cpm15, cpm17: lava

No lights at all:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ermo's-home
- cpm25, cpm27 - only skylight (+ trisurf light from water)
