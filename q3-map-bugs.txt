- dum:
  - have long entity string (not enough +4k for entstring, added 16k)
  - have unsupported here "target_push" and "target_teleporter" entities
  - undergroung: skeleton cell: uses translucent surface with lightmap (?) - incorrect PostLight()
! q3dm2 (as example): water shader painted after rail shader !!!

- ut4_abbey: when shooting, will crash in GenerateTexCoordArray() (dlights?)
- cpm15: have "target_teleporter" entities
  - teleporter {-1090,710,-260} does not works (teleport dst == src) + teleporters not displayed
    (separate model?)
- cpm18r: {974,-465,558}, look to {1088,-489,620}, gl_labels=2: moving up-down 3 models, central
  occluded (shold not)
! map "q3dm13" (start) -> "q3dm19" (run few seconds) -> "q3matcho...": will display console w/o cursor,
  when "toggleconsole" -> cursor appears; no game mode; when "vid_restart" ->
  "R_FindModel: not found: *9"
  "ERROR: CM_InlineModel: bad number"
  (unstable, but frequent bug)

- q3dm19: "func_bobbing" with "model2" (attached md3 model)
- cpm15: no SURF_SKY on sky surface (incorrect collision) -- may be, should collide with trisurf, not brush?
- pom: incorrect dlights
- cpm26: have movable surface light: {690, 2760, 160} (sliding door)
- af3hex: lots of visual bugs (some things not displayed)
  ? uses patches for this
- q3dm7: renderer uses darker lights from sky - possibly, sky shader was changed after lightmaps created
  (before compilation sky had brighter light values)
- scienselab (UT): glass textures: draw order issues (look at one glass through another)

Bad maps, kept for incorrect drawing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- runhamster: lots of glass surfaces, incorrect lighting
- spacegl: invisible glass surfaces

Jumppad bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- q3dm17: have floating "armor", which cannot be reached
- klcurces: incorrect behaviour of 'curved' trampolines

Cannot load:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- q3dm6 (TMP): game.dll parser errors
  (placed in q3dm6tmp.pk3; contains missing opening quote, but have closing quote: check next entity after
  "model" "*3" - "trigger_push")
- paradise: SV_FindIndex(...md2) overflow -- too much models

Large maps (out of possible q2 ranges)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- qxctf2
- evotm: map completely outside q2 world bounds
- rjlctf2
- 17plus-ctf

unsupported sky surfaces:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- milktdm1: curve sky: textures/skies/hellsky2bright

Patch lights:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- aetime
- pro-q3dm6
- q3dm4, q3dm10, q3dm11, q3dm12
- cpm14

Trisurf lights:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- cpm15, cpm17: lava

No lights at all:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ermo's-home
- cpm25, cpm27 - only skylight (+ trisurf light from water)
