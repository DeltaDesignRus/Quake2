- allow custom targets:
  - 'out "test"' -> print to makefile
  ? should print after other text is out
- allow "install" target (via "out") ?
- "exit" command (break makefile creation; no needs to generate error - already have "error" cmd)
  ? exit should simply return EOF for source file ("!exit" ??)
  * this will allow creation of makefiles with "install" target only
