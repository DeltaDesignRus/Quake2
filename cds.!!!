SOMETHING WAS CHANGED, SO NEEDS TO CHECK THIS:

- disable CDS on minimization in Win9x:
  1) TNT2 - taskbar appears until vid_restart (SetForegroundWindow will not
     help)
  2) Blade3D - same + sometimes cannot restore res (CDS(game) + CDS(0) -!)
- Vid_DestroyWindow(): ShowWindow(wnd,SW_HIDE) before destroying will
  prevent from appearing empty button on taskbar (Win9x), but will deactivate
  window when Vid_DestroyWindow(force=false) because of hiding
- when recreating glContext on the same window (force=false), some videocards
  (at least, Blade3D) will not be able to create new context -- should destroy
  window + create new window + create context on a new window
  (try GetLastError() -- what is it ??!!)
- WIn9x: vid_restart will restore resolution (via WM_SIZE+MINIMIZE)
! should centralize resolution changes: do not restore desktop res when not
  minimized (check WM_SIZE correctness ?)
  ? place to GLimp_Activate(), call CDS simputaneously with minimize/restore
--------------------------------------------------------
- try TNT with 16 <-> 32 bit change with "force=false"
