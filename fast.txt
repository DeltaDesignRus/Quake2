- replace Sys_Find() and Sys_MkDir() with FileSystemWin32.cpp, then can remove q_shwin.cpp ...
=============
- cmd.cpp -> Commands.cpp (Core) & cbuf.cpp (qcommon)
  - SplitCmdline == TokenizeString, diff is 1. delim = '-', 2. delim = ';' (or ' ' ??!)
  - MacroExpand(), cmd_debug, CL_ForwardToServer() -> cbuf code; should parse comments in cfg files here
     too (remove them after FS_LoadFile(cfgfile) !?)
- DeltaEntity():
  - for new protocol try plib-like (dcc32) delta func; display compression ratio (may use old-style delta and
    measure compression for new-style for testing); best place for testing - client (here can test demos too)
  - can create DeltaCompress() and DeltaDecompress() functions for plib-style compression
  - if upgrade compression, should parse demos with
    a) original protocol b)ext protocol, but old-style delta
    c) ext protocol and new-style delta;  may be, change EXT_PROTOCOL_ID too (add version number)
