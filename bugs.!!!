?* after timedemo in game (in demo too ...), can receive "server is out" state
?! savegame shot: when loading game/show "load menu" from non-baseq2, shot will be displayed when it is not exists in current mod,
   but exists in baseq2 (incorrect shot; BUT: situation, when save exists but shot -- not, may be treated as incorrect)
- explosions are invisible through non-transparent water (incorrect server-side PVS cull ?)
! sometimes key_up skipped (or key_down spontaneously pressed) (Win2K bug ?)
- map "temple2", "lavatube" -- waterfall: bullet sounds (change sound for water sparks, change place for water bullet sounds
  or something another ??)
- dedicated server: work without ref, so - crush when try some things (i.e. "com_speeds 1") --> make fake ref
  (and add support for colors, scrolling etc.)

- Sys_Error(ERR_FATAL): sometimes not restore mouse (crush in "special place" ?)

- bugs with deathmatch mode
  - map "dm_dukecity_beta":
    - disco: neon lamp text should not disappear
  ? g_misc.c::SP_light() -- disabled lights with style>=32
- dir "../dirty/maps" will display the same list twice
- when sound is busy, error about "command already registered" appears for sound commands

! cannot load map "dog..." in soft: "bad surface extents 272 x XXX" (but GL can ...; seems, ref_soft
  can't render texture with larger than 256 size ...)
! map "toomuchbloodv2": sound "dmg/TISM.wav" loaded twice (upper- and lowercase)

? game crush in msvcrt.dll (pak loading/unloading/download breaking/map not found)
? crush on map change/game load (cl_predict, CM_TransformedPointContents2(); bad leaf pointer ?)
  (Anachronox: crush when door/elevator moving somewhere on level -- absolute pointers)

- CapsLock displayed as an unknown key

- z-buffer bugs with glass floor on omd_map1

- ref_soft/r_poly.c "R_PolygonScanLeft(Right)Edge ()" should be rewritten
  ("ground3": early - crash, now - lost polygons ...)
- ref_soft hangs on map "japan" (from Kingpin)

? once game was crushed (after singleplayer) with Z_FreeTags(TAG_LEVEL): zero in chain
- bug: "game baseq2;unloadpak q2maps;game bad_dir(?);demomap demo1;game baseq2(?);demomap demo1"
  (1st demomap - "cannot load map (q2maps not loaded)", 2nd - "bad map contents (pak loaded, but name cached??)"

ref_gl:
  DrawTile(): when viewport is small and gl_clear=1 - bugs on a left screen part

ref_oldgl:
  map passin;map passin (BUGS!!!); map rexro (CRUSH!!!)  (this bug found only for passin -- bad map? no bug when "flushmap 1")

- map team_harbor: PF_SetModel() -- NULL name
- once: tried to draw main menu cursor with a negative image number (should be 0..15): menu.c :: M_DrawCursor() (added "unsigned" to
  resolve ?)
