* lightmaps: q1: when no lightmap on non-warp surface, it will be completely dark ?

- BrushTrace()
- BoxTrace() -- TraceToLeaf() + TestInLeaf()

- texture loading:
  * from map (q1)
  - from wad (hl)
  - should delete all textures (map textures) on next map loading:
    - q1: embedded textures: should delete all on map change (different maps -- may be different textures
      with the same name)
    - hl: wad textures: different maps => different wads ...

- surface flags (translucent, sky, warp ...)
  + check 'Docs/hl.txt'
- surface sounds (hl)

- entities

- ambient sounds (see dBsp1Leaf_t)

- .mdl models for Q1 (torch etc)

- visinfo
- check player trace bounds + viewheight for q1/hl
- hl: increase entity limit (CS_... -- SV_FindIndex())
* hl: sky in entity
- q1/hl: check lightstyle strings
? force ext protocol for clients
- check animation cycle in q1 and hl for '+0texture'
